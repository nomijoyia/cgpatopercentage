  <h2>🌟 Why Your CGPA Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#F9F4FF; border-color:#E0D6EB;">
    CGPA measures academic consistency—not creativity or grit.<br>
    Many brilliant minds shine outside rigid grading systems.<br>
    Lahore’s streets hum with self-taught coders and poets.<br>
    They never topped class but now lead bold ventures.<br>
    Numbers simplify. People complicate beautifully. Trust the journey. 💡

  <h2>📊 From CGPA to Percentage: The Quick Conversion</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#E6F7FF; border-color:#CCE6FF;">
    Most Pakistani universities use this formula: Percentage = CGPA × 9.5.<br>
    It’s a rough estimate—not an exact science.<br>
    Always check your institution’s official conversion policy first.<br>
    Some use 9.0 or even 10.0 multipliers.<br>
    Clarity prevents last-minute panic during job applications. ✨
  </div>

  <h2>🎯 When Percentages Matter More Than CGPA</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#FFF8E1; border-color:#FFECB3;">
    Government jobs often demand percentage-based eligibility cutoffs.<br>
    Scholarships abroad may require precise percentage equivalents.<br>
    Private firms in Lahore increasingly accept CGPA—but not all.<br>
    Know your audience. Tailor your transcript accordingly.<br>
    A smart conversion can open unexpected doors. 🗝️
  </div>

  <h2>🔍 Common Mistakes Students Make</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#FFECEC; border-color:#FFD2D2;">
    Assuming all universities follow the same conversion rule.<br>
    Rounding CGPA too early—lose accuracy in final percentage.<br>
    Using online calculators without verifying their source.<br>
    Never trust random tools with your academic future.<br>
    Double-check with your registrar or academic advisor. 🛑

  <h2>💼 Real-World Wisdom from Lahore’s Graduates</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#E8F5E9; border-color:#C8E6C9;">
    A friend scored 2.9 CGPA but built a startup.<br>
    He now hires grads based on portfolios—not just grades.<br>
    Lahore rewards hustle as much as honors.<br>
    Your degree opens the door. Your work keeps it open.<br>
    Let numbers guide—not define—you. 🌱
  </div>

  <h2>✅ Final Takeaway: Own Your Narrative</h2>
  <div class="box" style="background:#F3E5F5; border-color:#D1C4E9;">
    CGPA is one chapter—not the whole book.<br>
    Convert wisely. Present clearly. Believe deeply in your growth.<br>
    Whether you’re from GC University or a night-class hero—<br>
    your value isn’t locked in a decimal point.<br>
    Write your story with courage and color. 🖋️
